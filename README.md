# Project: Relationship and risk tracking
[DevPost project](https://devpost.com/software/proposal-relationship-and-risk-tracking)

Project members (the project has forked):

- Giorgio Anastopoulos: Implementing a web-base app based on javascript that will work for AWS. Looking for front-end developer.

- Kevin M체ller: Working on a prototype on Matlab, which is given in this git

## Introduction

This application allows to create a social map or net in order to give a better idea of the progress of the coronavirus, and it has been build for large-scale usage. This application can be combined with other idea for information gathering in order to provide a major application to fight the coronavirus. 

The main idea is that each user enters a set of information about him/her and who he/she had an social interaction with. Hence, a social map is obtained and we can see in real time how the coronavirus progress in this social map.

There are three objectives:
1째 Give useful data, which is not currently obtained, that allows to monitor better the spread of the coronavirus. Hence, better measure against the coronavirus can be done.
2째 The user know which person it is more risky to have a close social interaction with. Therefore, it provides a better risk assessment at the level of the user.
3째 It gives who is in quarantine, allowing the user to offer his/her support (like buying foods or calling him/her). Some people that may have the virus still go to a food store because they are not asking for support.

## The matlab code

The matlab code provided here is a mock up of an app, which is robust and should be able to handle a Swiss-scale scenario. For the moment, in the database, the user has an health state (healthy, sick, critical condition), a location (postal code) and a list of relative/friend. For each relative/friend, he/she can see his/her health state and if he/she knows someone who got the coronavirus (or who knows someone who got the coronavirus, a social distance of 3). Additional information about the user and his/her friends/relatives can be included if necessary.

The mock-up works in the following way. An user pressing a certain button is replaced by a call of the function, which has the format:

db_cv = user_"action"(db_cv, "user name", input parameter);

where db_cv is the database. The output seen by an user is given by:

user_info = output_user_data(db_cv, "user_name") ;

where user_info is a structure containing everything it sees on the GUI. If you want more type of output, do not hesitate to contact me.

At the beginning, call:

db_cv = memory_allocate_new_table(init_size) ;

where init_size is the initial size of the database. It will initialize the database.

Every function has its description at the beginning of the '.m' file. There is the function "test_script_1" that creates a simple scenario (it is a list of action done by users). There is also a bigger social map given in "data_scenario.json" written by Giorgio. Do not hesitate to create new scenario and sharing them.

When writing a scenario, please use the user id instead of the user name when calling a "user_..." function. Searching the user name in the database is not optimized.

Finally, do not hesitate to ask for new functionalities. I would happy to provide them.

## About the futur

This code is the core of the program. From there, multiple type of work can be done:

- Testing: the code provided here should be robust but we never know.

- Creating scenario: it can be for testing code or just to play with the code and get a feeling about what is missing or not well implemented

- Designing a GUI: If it becomes an app, it is necessary. Also important in order to advertise this work and gain momentum. If you are interested to do in javascript, Giorgio is also interested.

- Analyzing the data: It is a good social map generator, so it gives you a good platform to see how you can interpret the data.

- Adding feature: This mock-up app is minimal in terms of data gathering (but already powerful), but it is straight forward to add new feature

- Translating the code in another language: Obviously, Maltab is not a language to implement an app, but it is easier to create an app based on a working prototype than from scratch. I will help you as much as I can in this process.
